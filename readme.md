## Purpose and Objective

Over the past few years, a number of novice or rare users of R have expressed a desire to learn more about R and, especially, how to use the R programming language to organize, munge and explore data. Too often, users are exposed to the R programming language as a vehicle to learn statistical analysis and not as a vehicle for learning concepts of computer programming, data manipulation and data exploration.

The R Lesson of the Week (R-LOTW) club will attempt to provide novice users exposure and experience using R as data exploration tool. By the end of the journey (52 weeks?), users should be able to 

1) efficiently load a dataset; 
2) organize, edit and join data tables; 
3) calculate summary statistics and perform 'group by' operations; 
4) connect to and query from a database; 
5) generate meaningful and production quality plots for visualizing data; and 
6) produce professional and reproducible reports (using the `knitr` and `rmarkdown` packages)

There are 3 Rules to the R-LOTW Club:

- Rule number 1: You never talk about R-LOTW club
- Rule number 2: You NEVER talk about R-LOTW club
- Rule number 3: If this is your first time at R-LOTW club you will code tonight

## Course Structure

To keep a sensible balance between commitments to this course and other work requirements and our personal lives, the focus of this course will be weekly exercises. Each week, students in the club will receive an email with at least two files. One will contain the lesson(s) for the week and, if written well, should provide a combination of explanatory text and example code that students can follow along and demonstrate for themselves. In addition to the weekly lesson, students will be given a homework assignment that will require the students to apply what they have learned from the lesson and then develop a report using `knitr` and `rmarkdown`.

Lessons will go out on Monday mornings and homework will be due the following Monday at noon (local time).
